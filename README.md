## Aptos NFT Studio

Aptos NFT Studio is an open source project with a custom Aptos Move smart contract for NFT and a web application for minting NFTs. 

Our primary goal is to provide full control to devs and artists who want to launch their NFT projects on Aptos.

All the code for the smart contract and web application is transparent, as well as easily customised/modified.

We have received a grant from Aptos for this project, which includes the 2 open source repositories and tutorial video.
